Stage 1 Challenge #4 — “Cleaning & Restoring Safely”

Situation (on main):

Your repo has app.txt with “Hello” committed.

You make these changes:

Modify app.txt to say “Hello world”

Create a new untracked file temp.log with any text in it

Create a new untracked folder drafts/ with a file inside

You decide:

Discard the changes in app.txt completely (restore from last commit)

Remove temp.log and everything in drafts/ without touching tracked files

Verify that your working directory is clean.

Your task:
Reply with the exact Git commands only (step-by-step, no explanations).

Answer:

# Step 1: Discard changes in app.txt
git restore app.txt

# Step 2: Remove untracked file
git clean -f temp.log

# Step 3: Remove untracked folder
git clean -fd drafts/

# Step 4: Verify clean working directory
git status
