tage 1 Challenge #5 — “History & Diff Like a Pro”

Situation (on main):

Your repo starts with app.txt containing:

Hello


committed as:

feat: add greeting


Make these commits in order:

feat: add subject → append World to app.txt

chore: add extra spacing → add a blank line after World

feat: add punctuation → change the text to:

Hello
World!


Your tasks:

Show the full history (hash + message + author + date) for app.txt only.

Show a graph view of the commit history for the entire repo, 1-line per commit.

View the exact changes introduced in the feat: add punctuation commit only.

Show the diff between the first and last commit for app.txt.

Your task:
Reply with the exact Git commands only (step-by-step, no explanations).

Answer:

git log --oneline --graph app.txt → shows commit history for app.txt (you used the short format; for full details you could switch to --pretty=format).

git show 7273ac2 -- app.txt → exact changes from that commit only.

git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD → got the very first commit hash.

git diff 41a31f2 HEAD -- app.txt → full diff from the first commit to now.
