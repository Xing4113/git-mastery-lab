Part 1 — Starting the feature

Create and switch to feature/profile-page.

Create profile.txt with:

Profile page initial draft


Commit with:

feat: add profile page draft

Part 2 — Mixed changes

Edit profile.txt to:

Profile page initial draft
Added contact section


Create README.md with:

# Project Documentation
This is a sample project.


Stage only profile.txt changes and commit:

feat: add contact section to profile page


Stage and commit README.md separately with:

docs: add project README

Part 3 — Mistakes happen

Edit profile.txt to:

Profile page initial draft
Added contact section
Added buggy gallery section


Commit with the wrong message:

feat: add gallery


Realize you forgot to mention that it’s buggy in the message — fix the last commit message to:

feat: add buggy gallery section

Part 4 — Cleanup

Create an untracked file debug.log with any content.

Create an untracked folder temp/ with a file inside.

Remove only the untracked file and folder, without touching tracked files.

Part 5 — Oops, wrong branch

Without committing, edit profile.txt to:

Profile page initial draft
Added contact section
Added buggy gallery section
Fixed gallery bugs


Realize you are still on feature/profile-page but this fix belongs on main.
Move your current uncommitted change to main safely (no copy-paste allowed).

Part 6 — History review

Show a compact graph of the full repo history.

Show the history of profile.txt only, with hash, date, author, and message.

Show the changes from the commit where you added the buggy gallery section.
